# hello

## What

This purpose of this repository is to create the smallest possible docker image that does something when run. 

To use, pick a language (current c, go, rust) -- the example uses c. Make sure docker is running, then:

```bash
$ docker build -t hello:c c
$ docker run hello:c
```

It's interesting to see how big the resulting images are:

```bash
# start from a clean docker system
$ docker system prune -af
# pre-pull all the base images for a better apples-to-apples comparison
$ for image in nimlang/nim:alpine alpine:latest golang rust:latest alpine:latest; do docker pull $image; done
# time each build
$ for l in c d go nim rust; do cd $l; time docker build . -t seanharrison/hello:$l; cd ..; done

## Why

A colleague recently told me about the scratch docker image, with which you can create a docker image that contains (almost) nothing but what you put into it. I took this as a challenge and started looking at ways to compile a tiny executable that would run on scratch with no operating system. 

I work with Python daily, and the resulting docker images are usually > 1 GB. I wanted to try something different.

I'm a minimalist and like small things.

To inspire myself and others.

## How

The hunt led me to musl for libc and C, Rust, and Go as contenders for writing the executable (ECL was also in the running, but I couldn't get the binary to compile with musl on Alpine â€” ECL seems to require glibc rather than musl for static linking of compiled binaries). 

From there it was straightforward:

1. Write a short "hello" program in C / Go / Rust. Usually the first bit of code you see for any language.
2. Compile it with the most compact static linking the platform provides.
3. Do that using a multistage Dockerfile, and copy the resulting executable into scratch.
